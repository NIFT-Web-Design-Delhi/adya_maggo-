          <h1 class="front-heading">KATHPUTLI</h1>
Kathputli is a string puppet performance and is an ancient and well-known form of folk entertainment. A Kathputli basically means a puppet made of wood. Kathputli dance and performance is one of the major tourist attractions of Rajasthan, the “Land of Maharajas”. The etymology of Kathputli is derived from the Sanskrit words for son or children, ‘ Puttika’ or ‘Puttalika’. It has been the oldest form of entertainment. In olden days these did not only entertained but also provided moral and social education.

            The earliest puppets probably originated in Egypt, where ivory and
            clay articulated pup- pets have been discovered in tombs. But it is
            truly Rajasthan's amazing kathputli which made India one of the
            first countries to invent its traditional puppetry. It is believed
            to have originated over 1500 years ago in a tribal Bhat community.

          <div class="item i2"><h1>HISTORICAL OVERVIEW</h1></div>
          <div class="item i6">
            Tradition of Kathputli is based on folk tales and stories. Scholars
            believe that folk tales convey the lifestyle of ancient Rajasthani
            tribal people and Kathputli art might have originated from present
            day Nagaur and surrounding areas. Rajasthani Kings and nobles were
            patrons of Art and Craft and they encouraged the craftsmen in these
            activities.

              Secondary sources claim that the industry revolves around the
              specific roleand responsibilities performed up by the individuals
              who are involved with it. Men and women take up roles that
              complement one another. Customarily men are in charge of executing
              the more tedious tasks such as, acquiring the resources, as well
              as carving the wood and giving the puppets an identity. m.While
              many women have taken up roles as housekeepers, there are many who
              concurrently work behind the curtains. They stitch the clothes
              which are worn by the dolls and paint the Kathputlis in vibrant
              hues.The women juggle more than one duty, they are designated to
              working in their homes, taking care of their children and
              supporting their husbands, who perform and sell the puppets.

              An art form that was once of great importance is now enduring a
              crisis; its artisans are struggling to earn a decent living. This
              struggle can be reflected in their homes and living conditions.
              Kathputli Nagar, a domicile for these artists, is an area of 789
              meters. Many of the NGOs which were looked into, focus on the
              empowerment of women and the upliftment of the community but don’t
              focus on the bigger picture. There are NGOs that are work- ing
              towards empowering the women of Kathputli Nagar. One such
              organization is Saarthak, which has recently begun working on
              improving their living conditions (Saarthak, 2020). While there
              are organizations like Saarthak that help these artists, there is
              a lack of secondary information on the effectiveness of these
              NGO‟s and whether they are sustainable in the long run.

            <div class="slide8-item1-content">
              The artists accused the digital age to be held responsible for the
              crisis the industry is enduring. They believe that modernization
              and the advent of film and TV have caused a drastic effect on the
              art forms sustenance. It has been brought to their knowledge that
              the current generation is a techno-de- pendent one and that they
              would rather spend time indulging their phones than allowing
              themselves to experience an age-old art form. This perspective can
              be used to study the reasons behind the decline in demand for the
              art form. This shift in demand has led to the artists earning less
              than what they previously were. Hence, The inhabitants of
              Kathputli Nagar prefer the younger generations to take up better
              paying jobs. While others have tried to keep this art form afloat
              not only for the means of their survival but also for the sake of
              culture.

              It is hard to enter the pink city and leave without having heard of
          the great and valiant leader, Maharana Pratap Singh of Udaipur. The
          reason for this admiration and unfaltering loyalty that exists till
          date is given in the stories recited by the puppeteers. The story of
          his glorious reign is a must have in the portfolio of every puppeteer
          and each one has their own variation.
          However, the themes of the shows also include: romance, drama, comedy,
          etc. A few characters and items like the court dancer, stunt horse
          rider, and snake charmer, are a necessity. Others would include the
          Magician who can detach his head from the rest of his body, Anarkali,
          pop stars, and many more.
